The initial response is the following: 
Right now, I work as a Medical Records Director and Consultant. But I just finished a web development bootcamp program learning JS, Express, React, and Node. I want to get my first software or web development job by job hunting and learning new development skills, maintain my current 9-5 job, get physically healthier, still have time in the week to go on a date on a weekly basis, watch shows, and still get at least 6 to 7 hours of sleep daily. Create a weekly plan for me to follow. 

Google LaMDA and ChatGPT free both created a schedule for me. However, Bing Chat needed a secondary prompt following its response which was a generic guide on how to create a routine.
